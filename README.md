## Summary

Similar to a flight data recorder, our device would make recordings based on what we have in the course kit. The key features of the hurrican box are:

Measurements temperature, acceleration, and possibly other values (such as battery level) Data sent from ESP32 sensors over WiFi Remote access through a portal to display a real-time data at remote client, in graphical form Remote access through a portal to control LEDs and to configure features at a remote client Webcam sourcing video, embedded in a single portal window

We were successfully able to: connect wirelessly and have remote access, control the alert LED from a remote interface with a simple on/off concept, prove a status report of temperature, vibration, battery level in real-time at remote client in strip-chart or equivalent way, using a web browser.
